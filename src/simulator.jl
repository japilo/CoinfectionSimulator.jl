Simulates multiple pathogen strains spreading through a host population with possible coinfection dynamics.

# Arguments
- `initial_pop::Vector{<:AbstractMatrix{Bool}}`: Vector of matrices representing the initial population. 
  Each matrix represents an individual, with rows corresponding to strains and columns 
  representing disease states (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered as `[S,E,I,R]`).
  Can be either Matrix{Bool} or BitMatrix.
- `ages::Vector{Int}`: Ages of each individual in the initial population.
- `interactions::Matrix{Float64}`: Matrix of interaction factors between strains. Values > 1 indicate 
  synergistic interactions, values < 1 indicate antagonistic interactions.
- `disease_type::Vector{String}`: Vector specifying model type for each strain. 
  Must be one of: "si", "sir", "seir", or "seirs".
- `base_mortality::Float64`: Background mortality rate per time step.
- `disease_mortality::Vector{Float64}`: Additional mortality rate for each strain when infected.
- `fecundity::Float64`: Mean number of offspring per mature individual per time step.
- `transmission::Vector{Float64}`: Transmission probability for each strain.
- `time_steps::Int`: Number of time steps to simulate.
- `age_maturity::Int`: Age at which individuals can reproduce.
- `introduction::String`: How strains are introduced: "simultaneous" (all at once) or 
  "random" (randomly throughout simulation) or "none" (no infections are introduced by the function). 
  Default is "simultaneous".
- `latency::Union{Vector{Int}, Nothing}`: Required for SEIR/SEIRS models. Vector of latency periods 
  for each strain (number of time steps in exposed state).
- `recovery::Union{Vector{Float64}, Nothing}`: Required for SIR/SEIR/SEIRS models. 
  Recovery probability for each strain.
- `immunity_loss::Union{Vector{Float64}, Nothing}`: Required for SEIRS models.
  Probability of losing immunity for each strain.

# Returns
A tuple containing:
1. Vector of population states at each time step, where each state is a vector of individual matrices
2. Vector of individual ages at each time step (in the same order as the population states)

# Disease State Format
Each individual is represented by an n×4 matrix where n is the number of strains:
- Column 1: Susceptible state (true if susceptible)
- Column 2: Exposed state (true if exposed, for SEIR/SEIRS models)
- Column 3: Infected state (true if infected)
- Column 4: Recovered state (true if recovered, for SIR/SEIR/SEIRS models)
